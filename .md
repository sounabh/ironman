# **Ironman Survival Game - Detailed Explanation**

## **Why Use Canvas?**
Canvas is used for rendering graphics efficiently in a web browser. It allows:
- Smooth animations.
- Dynamic updates to graphics without reloading the page.
- High-performance rendering of game objects.
- Precise control over drawing elements.

## **Game Initialization**
### **window.onload**
- Triggers when the webpage fully loads.
- Initializes the game by setting up the canvas, loading assets, and starting the game loop.

### **Canvas Selection & Context Setup**
- `document.getElementById("canvas")` is used to select the canvas element.
- `getContext("2d")` retrieves the 2D rendering context for drawing.

### **resizeCanvas**
- Ensures the canvas always matches the browser window.
- Dynamically adjusts `canvas.width` and `canvas.height` on window resize.

## **Game State Variables**
### **gameState** (Object)
- Stores all game-related data:
  - **Ironman Properties:** Position, size, movement, and image.
  - **Attackers Array:** List of enemies.
  - **Score:** Tracks points.
  - **Game Over State:** Indicates if the game has ended.
  - **Attacker Images:** Stores images of enemy objects.

## **Ironman Movement**
### **moveIronman(e)**
- Controls movement based on keyboard input:
  - **Space/ArrowUp:** Moves Ironman up.
  - **ArrowRight:** Moves right.
  - **ArrowLeft:** Moves left.
- Disabled when the game is over.

## **Spawning Attackers**
### **attackOn**
- Generates a new enemy every 2.5 seconds.
- Selects a random image from `attackerImages`.
- Positions the enemy at the rightmost edge (`canvas.width`) with a random vertical position.
- Adds the new attacker to `gameState.attackers`.

## **Collision Detection**
### **detectCollision(ironman, attacker)**
- Checks if Ironman collides with an enemy.
- Compares their positions.
- If overlapping, returns `true`, signaling a game over.

## **Game Over Handling**
### **drawGameOver**
- Displays the "GAME OVER" screen.
- Darkens the screen.
- Shows the final score and a message prompting the player to restart.

## **Game Loop (Updating the Game State)**
### **update(currentTime)**
- Continuously updates and redraws game elements.
- Applies gravity to Ironman.
- Updates Ironman’s position while preventing movement beyond canvas boundaries.
- Moves attackers across the screen.
- Checks for collisions; if detected, sets `gameOver` to `true`.
- Increments score when attackers move off-screen.
- Displays the current score.
- Calls `requestAnimationFrame(update)` to continue the game loop.

## **Restarting the Game**
### **resetGame**
- Resets all game variables.
- Clears attackers and resets Ironman’s position.
- Restarts the game loop.

## **Handling Key Presses**
### **document.addEventListener("keydown")**
- Listens for keyboard events.
- If the game is over and `Space` is pressed, restarts the game.
- Otherwise, calls `moveIronman(e)` for movement.

## **Attacker Spawn Interval**
### **setInterval(attackOn, 2500)**
- Calls `attackOn` every 2.5 seconds to introduce new enemies.

## **Starting the Game Loop**
### **requestAnimationFrame(update)**
- Starts the game loop for continuous rendering and animation.
